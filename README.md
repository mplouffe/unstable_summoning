NOTE: THIS REQUIRES A DIRTY HACK TO RUN PROPERLY <br>
This repo is now using a custom modded version of bracket-lib that allows batching of sprites. <br>
I should set it up properly to support this modified dependency, but right now it's just a dirty hack on my local machine. <br>
I've included a copy of the modded command_buffer.rs file in the docs section of this repo to make the dirty hack even greasier. <br>
